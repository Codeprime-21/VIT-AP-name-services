Hello peeps!
You might have seen people buying some cool .eth domains from the Ethereum Name Service(ENS), associated with their Ethereum crypto account. They show off that domain name everywhere you might've seen "randomperson.eth" kind of usernames on Twitter mostly. 
It's just like the domain names you own for your companies or your organization. But, here it would have your crypto account wallet associated with it. So, whenever let's say there are hundreds and thousands of clients that you don't know, want to do transactions with you and send some crypto in where you are open for such transactions...What would you do? and how would you do without taking stress talking to everyone and getting your DMs filled?
You could share your Account address! But, even if a character goes wrong, the whole payment will be made to some random person on the earth!ðŸ¤£
So, to make it easier, domain names are made!
But, the thing is "We have to buy them" and pay "gas fees" now and then to maintain them, which could be a little costly for your pocket
And in most cases, we will not get our desired domain name as some other person might've bought it already.
So, I did this project, where I created a naming service in my college name ".vitap"
It was essentially built just for my college students as a decentralized identity that has several use cases more than the college ID card ever would have. 
For now, this project is just "functional". I will come back to this later to develop it into a much more efficient "decentralized one-stop application" which basically can eradicate unethical things and maintain transparency of transactions between the management and the students (and also between the students themselves)
Coming back to the point, people can enter the name they want as a domain. Ex. prashanth.vitap, enter their register number(It's the most used thing in my college after our first name. So used it..hehe)and press that mint button while having their Metamask installed, and connected to polygon Mumbai testnet, pay the gas fee according to the length of the domain name they need and boom, see the NFT minted on the "opensea" testnet with all the required transaction ID hashes.
I have essentially done and deployed it on testnets cuz I don't have funds to deploy it on mainnet lol and it's an experimental project. So, have fun getting your NFTs minted, and please take some time tweeting it, tagging me @ username displayed at the bottom of the homepage of this project!

Here's the actual project functional link:

Here are some cool images from this project:

I would be more than happy if you guys can contribute to this project by providing some serious functionalities, so that we collectively make this project an official one-stop decentralized website for literally every college. 

Good luck out there and Cheers!

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
